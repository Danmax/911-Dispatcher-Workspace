# Welcome!
Hola! @MGOPW here. This repository houses a workspace meant to be used by 911 operators to handle calls and dispatch emergency responders as needed. We've started it out, but help us finish it and make it awesome! Something important to note is that you should **not** work in the default page for the workspace. You should do all your work in a variant and then commit that in your Pull Request.

Other resources you should check out:
- [Next Experience Center of Excellence](https://www.servicenow.com/community/next-experience-articles/next-experience-center-of-excellence/ta-p/2332092) - This is the main place where we post Next Experience, Workspace, and UI Builder enablement materials.
- [You & I Builder Live](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3rNcyAiDYK2Bgzj4mRdtfxMpGkI5KXBJ) - A more technical and in-depth view in to UI Builder packaged in a hilarious and casual format. Come hang out in chat and learn some UI Builder while you're at it!
- [Next Experience Academy](https://www.servicenow.com/community/next-experience-blog/next-experience-academy-upcoming-and-recorded-sessions/ba-p/2272673) - Monthly webinar series we host for all audiences, all academies are uploaded to [this youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuli92FRGC0&list=PLkGSnjw5y2U6hmEPcDcJ53FHwKJIvoLvr) after the fact.

And lastly, this repository is part of a larger coordinated effort by the ServiceNow Developer Advocate to provide lots of fun ServiceNow projects for Hacktoberfest. Be sure to check out the [main repository README](https://github.com/ServiceNowDevProgram/Hacktoberfest) to see what else you can participate in!
 
# What do I need to know?
- Consider this repository as a blank template you can make in to an awesome application. It's really bare bones right now, but think of useful features you want to add!
- We've created issues to list out contribution ideas you might want to pick up! Or if you think of new stuff to contribute, make a new issue and let us know what you're going to work on.
- To see the workspace, you have to give yourself the role `x_sinc_911_operat_0.admin` or it will not show up in the workspace listing.
